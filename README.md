# Project for CISC 4597 Artificial Intelligence and the Robotics & Computer Vision Lab at Fordham University
- Created a tracking system using real-time object detection (YOLOv3), bounding box centroids, and trajectories using OpenCV to help zoologists at the Bronx Zoo study the behavior of the Kihansi spray toad
- Worked on a semi-supervised method to detect swarm behaviors indicating dominant behavior using a convolutional neural network in PyTorch
- cross_val.py contains the code I used to train & validate a custom YOLO v3 object detector on a GPU-equipped computing cluster. I began working on an unsupervised method for studying how the Kihansi Spray toad expresses dominant behaviors but this work got delayed indefinitely due to COVID-19
- summary.pdf explains how I compared the custom YOLO v3 toad tracker with another custom RGB-D toad tracker written by another student working at the Robotics & Computer Vision lab
- poster.pdf is the poster I presented at the Bronx Zoo
