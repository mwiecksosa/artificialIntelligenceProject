# Custom YOLO Toad Tracker 

- cross_val.py contains the code I used to validate a custom YOLO v3 object detector I used for tracking toads and studying their behavior
- summary.pdf explains how I compared the custom YOLO v3 toad tracker with another custom toad tracker written in C++ that uses RGB video and a depth sensor written by another student working at the Fordham Robotics lab
